# odin-recipes

This is my odin-recipes project for the odin-project curriculum.

It will contain couple of links to recipes I am fond of.

Once the project is completed, I will have demonstrated that I understand
that the making of a html website comprises of elements, arguments, expressions, 
and good commit practices to git.
